# MyLittleScriptingCar _–⁠ Arduino part_

This is part of my project, that is dedicated to arduino.
For now, it contains [main.cpp](./src/main.cpp) and my custom library for controlling stepper motors –⁠ [EightStepMotor](./lib/EightStepMotor/)

In the future, this will contain all the code, that will be uploaded on the arduino, which means UART comunication, Ultrasonic senzor and maybe IMU and servo, but I'll might leave those out...

Also, there's a dependency in [platformio.ini](./platformio.ini) on Arduino Stepper library, but I used that library just as a reference, so it will get deleted later.
